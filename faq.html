·:·:· Product Information ·:·:·


▶ I haven’t bought the game yet, but it looks great! What is it about? How does it play?
<answer>
Stone Story is an unusual game that fuses genres by mixing RPG with incremental/idle gameplay and programming elements. You don’t control the character directly; instead, you make decisions about equipment and crafting, adjusting to the enemies and challenges you face.

The beginning of Stone Story can be thought of as a puzzle. Mystery and discovery are guiding forces as you progress through the locations and begin to amass items. As your gear grows powerful, the game transitions to a more incremental/idle play style as you tackle harder locations. All the while, it maintains puzzle and RPG mechanics, as challenges can be approached in creative ways.

A system of side-quests (Legends) offers an alternate way to progress, through adventures rich in dialogue and NPCs.

The experience expands to infinite depth with a crafting system rich in choices, as well as the game's built-in scripting language, Stonescript-- unlocking combat automation, cosmetics and modding.
</answer>

▶ What is an incremental/idle game?
<answer>
Incremental and idle games focus on long term building of strength and/or resources, largely through hands-off gameplay. Incremental mechanics typically involve leaving the game alone for a few hours and coming back to manage your gains in order to improve the speed/efficiency of gaining even more stats and resources.

In Stone Story, incremental gameplay is best exemplified with loot farming. You can leave SSRPG alone to horde equipment drops and fuse them together to craft even stronger gear.
</answer>

▶ How long is the game?
<answer>
The main storyline takes about 6-8 hours. But that's only the beginning. It takes a few days to play through all the Legend quests. Beyond that, there are higher difficulties to unlock, cosmetics and more loot to hoard! Some players have clocked more than 5,000 hours in the dark world.
</answer>

▶ I've missed many of the limited-time events. How can I participate in those?
<answer>
The quests and items that appear in events are available through regular gameplay. In a way, the community events are celebratory moments when new pieces of content are added. There is really no way to go back in time and un-celebrate improvements to the game! That said, some popular challenges may return in new or adjusted forms. Also, some of the limited-time events are setup to repeat each year (e.g. Summer Moonstice 2x loot).

▶ What are the game’s shortcut keys?
<answer>
Space – Pause Menu
I – Inventory
L - If paused, leaves the location
Q – Drink Potion 
R – Activate equipped weapon’s special attack
M – Edit the Mind Stone script
</answer>

▶ Where are the Save files located?
<answer>
<font color=#ffffff>iOS & Android:</font> On mobile your saved data is stored on iCloud/Google Drive and you can't access it directly. However, you can modify your saved data with the [Export] and [Import] buttons at the bottom of the Saved Games dialog. Exporting your data copies it into the clipboard, allowing you to paste it elsewhere, as a form of manual backup.

<font color=#ffffff>Windows:</font> C:/Users/userName/AppData/LocalLow/Martian Rex, Inc_/Stone Story/(steam id)/primary_save.txt
  
<font color=#ffffff>MacOS:</font> ~/Library/Application Support/Martian Rex, Inc_/Stone Story/(steam id)/primary_save.txt
  
<font color=#ffffff>Linux:</font> (your Steam install location for SSRPG)/Martian Rex, Inc_/Stone Story/(steam id)/primary_save.txt
typical install location: ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Stone Story RPG/
</answer>

▶ Is it possible to move my save data between devices, such as from mobile to PC?
<answer>
Yes:
  1. Open Stone Story RPG on the device with the data you want to copy.
  2. From the main menu, navigate to the Saved Games screen.
  3. Press the [Export] button at the bottom of the screen. This copies your save file into the device's clipboard.
Now you need to move the data to the destination device. Here's one way to do it:
  4. Write a new email, with yourself as destination.
  5. In the body of the email, paste the save file that is in the clipboard.
  6. Send the email to yourself and open it on the destination device.
  7. Select the save file data in the body of the email and copy it to your clipboard.
  8. Open Stone Story RPG on the destination device.
  9. From Saved Games, press the [Import] button at the bottom of the screen.
</answer>

▶ I’ve lost my save, is there anything I can do?
<answer>
Yes! The first thing you should do is navigate to the save location mentioned above then follow the steps below: 
  1. Copy the “backup.txt” file and rename it to “primary_save.txt”. 
  2. Check the game to see if it worked.
  3a. If that worked, congratulations!
  3b. If not, copy the most recent “historical_#” file and rename it to “primary_save.txt”
  4. Check the game to see if it worked.
  5. Repeat the last two steps until you’ve recovered a viable save.
  6. Help improve the game by reporting the issue in the <a href="https://discord.gg/StoneStoryRPG" target="_blank">SSRPG Discord</a>. Tell us what happened!
</answer>

▶ How do I access the beta?
<answer>
To switch to and from the beta branch:
  1. Close Stone Story
  2. In your Steam library, right-click "Stone Story RPG" then select "Properties"
  3. Select the "Betas" tab
  4. Select the branch you want, then close Properties
[!Warning!: beta builds can have game breaking bugs]

·:·:· Basic Gameplay ·:·:·


▶ What’s the best set of weapons?
<answer>
Stone Story RPG has a strong focus on using the right weapons for the right job. As you progress, you’ll have different priorities that dictate which equipment best solves your needs at the time.
</answer>

▶ No, for real though, what are the best weapons?
<answer>
Big Swords are effective against mobs and Small Swords have the highest DPS, while Shields and Hammers are great for stacking up armor.
</answer>

▶ What are Æther and Vigor? What are these symbols on my gear?
<answer>
There are 5 elements in the game: Poison (∞), Vigor (♥), Æther (*), Fire (φ) and Ice (❄).
  
Most enemies have an element associated with them. You can use the Sight Stone’s equipped ability to inspect enemies and learn about their type and weakness. Elements will also provide unique bonuses to your gear, depending on how they're used. Experiment with the crafting to find out!
</answer>

▶ What does Unmake mean?
<answer>
To be Unmade is to evaporate into pure Ki. Some Æther weapons have a special ability that can instantly Unmake foes. This usually does not work on bosses.
  
Usually.
</answer>

▶ How do I get more wands? / How do I get more [element] runes?
<answer>
Each area has an element associated with it, which causes that element's rune to drop.
  Poison (∞) in the Caves of Fear and the Temple
  Vigor  (♥) in the Mushroom Forest
  Æther  (*) in the Haunted Halls
  Fire   (φ) in the Bronze Mines
  Ice    (❄) in the Icy Ridge
The final boss can drop any of the elemental runes.

The exception to this is Deadwood Canyon; instead of runes, it drops increased amounts of basic equipment (especially Wands).
</answer>

▶ Is there a faster way to craft stuff? Getting past 5☆ takes too long.
<answer>
The best way to craft higher star equipment is to combine the base items up to the star level you want, then fuse those into the final item you want.

Example:    
  Sword + 63 Swords = 6☆ Sword
  Wand + 63 Wands = 6☆ Wand
  6☆ Sword + 6☆ Wand = 6☆ Stone Sword 
</answer>

▶ Why did the effect of my equipment change when I upgraded it?
<answer>
When fusing two runed items of different suffixes, the suffix of the item on the left becomes the suffix of the resulting item.
 ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (ah) + ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (A) = ☆☆ Vigor Shield ☆☆ (ah)
 ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (A) + ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (ah) = ☆☆ Vigor Shield ☆☆ (A)
</answer>

▶ How do I determine which rune suffix I get when crafting items?
<answer>
When crafting a rune with a stone item, the side the rune is on determines the suffix the resulting item is given. 
  If the rune is on the left it will have a minor bonus to armor or damage and a special effect based on the element of the rune.
  If the rune is on the right it will be given a large, singular bonus to armor or damage against foes weak to the element of the rune.
  
For example when a Vigor rune is fused into a Stone Shield, if the rune is on the left it'll be given the suffix (ah); if it's on the right it'll be (A).
  ☆ Vigor Rune ☆ + ☆ Stone Shield ☆ = ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (ah)
  ☆ Stone Shield ☆ + ☆ Vigor Rune ☆ = ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (A)

A notable exception to this is when crafting either a Staff or a Hammer. 
The Staff and Hammer have 6 potential suffixes. As a result, the crafting of these items is somewhat less predictable. If you don’t get the suffix you wanted when crafting, it is recommended to use the Mutate workstation to change it.
</answer>

▶ What does the Quest Stone do? 
<answer>
The Quest Stone unlocks a series of side-quests. Some are basic quests and others are Legends. Basic quests are simple quantitative goals, such as defeating X enemies of a specific type. Legends, on the other hand, are dialog-rich stories that expand the dark world. In Legends you encounter NPCs, solve non-combat problems and unlock new areas to explore.

When equipped, the Quest Stone is a good way to supplement the armor generation of shields, as it can be equipped on both hands. Meanwhile, shields have to be specifically equipped on the right hand.

Additionally, weekly quests can be unlocked after completing the Legend "Remnants of Five". These weekly quests focus on progression of locations, such as unlocking a higher difficulty or improving the average clear time of a location.
</answer>

▶ What does the Mutate workstation do?
<answer>
Mutating items changes something about them.
  
A weapon with a rune slotted changes which suffix it has (ex. dP > D).
A base weapon like a sword will turn into another base item (ex. a Wand into a Shield).
A rune on its own, not slotted into anything, will turn into another type of rune (ex. Poison(∞) > Ice(❄)).

The result from the mutation is randomized. 
</answer>

▶ What are Ki Crystals for?
<answer>
Ki Crystals are a rare currency in the dark world. They are introduced in the Legend "Remnants of Five", but can also be: earned as a daily reward, found in Delta treasures, from special community events, and are the main reward for completing weekly quests.

▶ What is Stonescript?
<answer>
Stonescript is an optional, late-game addition that unlocks when you find the Mind Stone. This allows automation and modding/cosmetics.

With the Mind Stone you can further automate your character (ex. having them drink potions if your health gets low). The most common use is to change weapons based on current conditions in the game. For example, when you face a specific boss you can automatically equip the best gear against it.

Stonescript also allows you to overlay custom ASCII art over the game; in a word, cosmetics. Maybe Pallas needs a hat or you have an idea for a pet? That's up to you!

See the <a href="https://stonestoryrpg.com/stonescript" target="_blank">introduction tutorial</a> to get started.

The Stone Story RPG installation comes with a collection of community-created scripts. These include pets, cosmetics, mini-games, UI and more. To see all built-in scripts, open the Mind Stone and in a new line type "import Fishing". Click the button that appears to the left of the word "import" to open the corresponding folder.
</answer>

▶ Programming? That sounds hard…
<answer>
Not to worry, Stonescript is for programmers of all expertise! Whether you're just starting out or a seasoned coder, Stonescript offers a wide variety of features that can help you bring your game to the next level.  

Strictly speaking, Stonescript is optional (though recommended). There is nothing stopping you from beating the game without it. However, if you are interested in giving it a go, the SSRPG community is full of helpful people willing to lend a hand. Got a script idea? Need to iron out some kinks in your code? We'll be more than happy to help!

▶ What is Acropolis? Is there a way to get there?
<answer>
Acropolis is a city and the home of the ascended. Not much is known about Acropolis at this time. However, it is the next destination of a certain intrepid stone person...

▶ Is there any benefit to enchanting a stat above 100% chance?
<answer>
In the case of healing items, if the chance is more than 100%, then there is a chance to heal 2 hitpoints instead of the usual 1.
</answer>

▶ What’s the maximum star/enchantment level?
<answer>
10☆, +21 enchantment.
</answer>

▶ What does the +X number mean on an enchanted (colored) item?
<answer>
The +Number means the bonus value given to a single stat on an item. Stats include things like damage, attack speed, armor, etc. When you level up an item normally, all the stats are improved per ☆ added. However, an enchantment affects a single stat and pushes it beyond the ☆ value.

When you look an item's details, the stat that is colored is the one boosted by the enchantment. You can change the enchanted stat by "Re-rolling" it on the Anvil.
</answer>

▶ Is the enchantment bonus lost if the item is fused on the Anvil?
<answer>
No. Enchantment quality is always preserved and additive. If you combine an enchanted sword with a regular shield it will result in an enchanted hammer.

Enchantments can also be removed from an item on the Fissure station and added to another item on the Anvil, without losing any bonus. This operation costs Ki.

The only case where you can lose enchantments is if you fuse two enchanted items together on the anvil. In this case the game warns you about the loss, so you can cancel the craft. If you decide to do this anyway, the lowest of the two enchantments is discarded. The correct way to fuse enchantments is on the Triskelion station.
</answer>

▶ What’s the difference between the various enchantment colors?
<answer>
The six enchantment colors are: Cyan, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red and Rainbow. They indicate the range of bonus. Cyan is always +1. Yellow is +2-3.  The different colors don't affect combat or stats, but they do indicate the underlying "quality" value of the enchantment and how they combine on the Triskelion. The logic is rather complicated, so there is the "Fuse+" where you don't have to think about it!
</answer>

▶ How do I get my weapon to be all rainbow-y?
<answer>
An item enchanted to +16 becomes transcendent and gets the cool rainbow effect. Pshow!
</answer>

▶ What are Lost items and what's the [1/2] that appears on them?
<answer>
Lost items are rare and powerful and cannot be made by crafting. They begin at 5☆. They are found in Delta treasures, in the Hotspring Shop and are given as rewards in some Legends.

To upgrade a Lost item you need to find additional copies of them. The [1/2] indicates how many copies you have found and how many you need until the next upgrade. In the example of [1/2], there is 1 copy and if it gets to 2 then it can upgrade. Lost items can also be "boosted" by large amounts of common items. This replaces the need to find extra copies of the Lost item. However, there are limits to how many times an item can be boosted per ☆ level.

▶ What’s the max character level?
<answer>
Currently, 60.
</answer>

▶ Is there an inventory limit?
<answer>
Un-opened treasures are limited by your character level, up to 400 treasures. There is no limit for other items.
</answer>

▶ How does the Ouroboros offline farming work?
<answer>
Offline farming allows you to turn off the game and collect the treasures when you come back. The total duration of the offline run depends on your performance at the chosen location, combined with your total treasure limit. When you play locations normally, the game tracks statistics such as the amount of damage taken and how much time it takes you to beat the location. If you let the location loop a few times it accelerates the gathering of these stats. If you see a red cross † in the location selection screen, that means the game calculates you will die before collecting all possible treasures. This can happen if you have potion refill disabled, not enough resources for potions or if you take too much damage or don't heal enough during your normal runs. In other words, you need to train a location and improve your performance to get better offline results.
</answer>

▶ Where can I learn more about the game?
<answer>
The Discord server is currently the best place to find information about the game. The devs and mods are always available and happy to answer any specific questions you might have. You can use Discord's search function to see if others have asked about what you’re looking for.

Several important pieces of information have been pinned for ease of discovery (particularly in #theorycraft).

If you need help, don't be afraid to jump on our Discord and just ask! The server is quite active and there’s usually someone willing to help.
  
There is a Stone Story RPG wiki, but it's currently being worked on by members of our community. If you'd like to help out, we always welcome more contributors.

▶ What does the ‘codes’ thing do in the options?

▶ The game plays/sounds great; who do I thank?
<answer>
The lead developer is Gabriel Santos (@standardcombo), with audio design by Rafael Langoni Smith (@LangoniSmith). 
  
Many other talented developers have also contributed to the project. Check the game’s credits to see the full list!
</answer>

▶ How was Stone Story made?
<answer>
The game's development started in 2014 and was first published in 2019 on Steam. It was written in C# on top of the Unity engine. The animations are text-art in ASCII style, typed the old-fashined way, frame by frame. Some procedural ASCII appears in visual effects, such as particles.
</answer>

▶ Is there anything I can do to help?
<answer>
The biggest way you can help Stone Story RPG is to spread the word about it. We're a small team and completely independent, meaning we're not attached to any publisher. This allows us to retain total creative control over the project, taking as much time as needed, and make the game that both we and our community want. 
  
However, as you might imagine, this means we're spread fairly thin! We don't have the benefit of a large marketing budget. If you share Stone Story RPG and get people talking about the game (especially streamers and YouTubers), that would help immensely towards the long-term health of the game and community.   

For something more hands-on with the project, the Discord server is a great place for you to be. By taking part in active discussion with suggestions and bug reports, you help to refine the game and create a better experience for other players.

Stone Story RPG would not be where it is right now were it not for the generous support of players like you.
