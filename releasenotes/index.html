- Fixed a bug where Fuse+ could be miscalculated and the game would get stuck in a deadend.
- Fixed a bug where the Dashing/Bashing shields could stop working if a foe survived behind the player.
- Fixed enchantment of the (F) and (f) abilities.
- Fixed an exploit where it was possible to clip through foes with the Quarterstaff due to a bug in the loading order of weapon variables.
- Fixed a bug where the player could get stuck in mid-air when defeating the Bronze Guardian.
- Fixed a crash when initiating offline farming in one save then loading another save where the Ouroboros had not been found yet.
- Moved the Mind Stone save data to the end of the save file, to reduce risk of arbitrary symbols from players interfering with other systems.
