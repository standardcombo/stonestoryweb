<answer>The release process for Stone Story is such that new versions are first pushed onto the Beta branch (Steam only). This branch continuously advances with new features until all planned changes for that version are complete and all known bugs are fixed. Then that version is pushed onto the main branch. At that point both branches will be the same, until new features begin development and the process repeats.

Changing your game to the Beta branch is a way to help make the game better and experience the new features before everyone else. This comes at the cost of stability, and risks such as losing progress if a critical bug is introduced into the Beta and messes things up. When playing on the Beta you should safeguard your progress by making backups of your save files or at least understand where the game automatically creates backups.

Stonescript - Advanced UI

This patch introduces a new system for building complex and performant user interfaces. This is a rework of the existing Button system, comprised of four object types: Panel, Button, Text and Anim. All of them inherit behavior from the common 'Component' type. The top-level UI namespace has also gained a few functions. See the Stonescript manual for details. Additions:

UI: ui.root, ui.AddPanel(), ui.AddText(), ui.AddAnim(), ui.AddStyle().

Component: x, y, w, h, absoluteX, absoluteY, anchor, dock, ax, ay, dx, dy, parent, visible.

Panel: children, clip, color, style, Clear(), Add(), Remove().

Button: SetDown(), SetUp().

Text: align, color, bgColor, lines, text.

Anim: color, duration, flipX, flipY, frame, isPlaying, isPaused, pivotX, pivotY, Load(string), playOnStart, loop, Pause(), Play(), Stop().
