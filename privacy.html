When you play our games you are trusting us with some of your data. We understand this is a big responsibility and we work to protect that data. This privacy policy attempts to explain what type of data we collect, why we collect it and how it is handled.

·:·:· What types of data ·:·:·


Anonymous & Aggregate
<answer>To increase privacy, the data we collect is mostly anonymous and aggregate. This includes gameplay actions, such as levels completed and items crafted. For this type of data we don't need to know the identity of players, only the volume of each type of action done by all players, collectively.</answer>

Personally Identifiable
<answer>In rare cases we may provide you with direct customer support. This usually occurs when you reach out to us directly for help, with a bug or other game issue. In such cases we may need personally identifiable data in order to complete the support.</answer>

Community Content
<answer>If you participate in <a href="https://discord.gg/stonestoryrpg" target="_blank">our community</a> spaces, any content you share or data you produce is governed by the terms of use and license agreements of the platforms in which you share it, and subject to their privacy policies. We may separately collect and store community content, such as fan art and game jam submissions.</answer>

Third Parties
<answer>Modern software is increasingly complex. Even for the simplest of games we rely on third party services in order to save your game progress, display ads and fulfill in-app purchases. In those cases, we do not keep any of your data—— instead, those third parties may retain your data. Please refer to the privacy policy of each of those third parties for more information:

<a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity</a>
Used for ads and in-app purchases.

<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google</a>
Used for saving game progress, achievements and in-app purchases on Android devices.

Used for analytics.

<a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank">Apple</a>
Used for saving game progress, achievements and in-app purchases on iOS devices.

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/" target="_blank">Steam</a>  
Used for saving game progress and achievements on PC.

·:·:· Why we collect data ·:·:·

<answer>
In one word: Fun. We are committed to making the best games possible. One way we do this is by applying the scientific method to study the probability of player actions, in order to: improve game designs, balance gameplay/economy and fix bugs. To complete these studies we need anonymous gameplay data. This approach results in games that are more engaging and fun for a larger portion of players.

Another critical use of player data is the storage of game progress in the cloud. Local storage of game progress is susceptible to loss and can't be transferred between devices. By storing your game progress in the cloud we allow you to continue playing exactly where you left off, and even opens the possibility of cross-platform saves.

In the case of in-app purchases, we sometimes need to save data related to transactions in order to fulfill them at a later date. This can happen when you begin a purchase, but we don't receive confirmation from the storefront (e.g. Google Play or App Store). To fulfill such purchases that are delayed by the storefront, we must retain some of your data.

·:·:· How data is handled ·:·:·

Third Parties
<answer>Data we gather is never sold to third parties. However, as mentioned <a href="#What">above</a>, we rely on third party services for many aspects of games. Those third parties handle storage of your data. Please refer to the privacy policies of each of those third parties for more information.</answer>

Legal Obligations
<answer>If, God forbid, we are legally compelled to do so, we may share some of your data with law enforcement or other such government institutions, as long as those requests for data are done in accordance with the law.</answer>

Community Content
<answer>In the case of community content, such as jam submissions, a license agreement specific to those events may be offered to you when you participate. Such an agreement will contain further details about your data and your rights, such as copyright.

<answer>
If you'd like to request deletion of your data, or have any questions, please contact us at contact@martianrex.com

Due to technical limitations, we may not be able to delete all your data. Our policy is to prioritize the deletion of personally identifiable information (such as email and names).

Some of your data stored by third parties may be under your own control to delete, such as iCloud, Steam or Google Play. If we are not able to delete it ourselves, our customer support will attempt to provide you with information on the relevant third parties and how to delete your data from them.
